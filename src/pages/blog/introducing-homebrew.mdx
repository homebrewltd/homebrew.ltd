# Introducing Homebrew ðŸ––

Homebrew is an AI research lab on building human-augmenting AI. Training energy-efficiently, serving privacy-first. 

We believe that AI should work alongside humans through human augmentation, making us better â€“ as thinkers, as tinkerers, and as human beings. 

To build AIs that run on energy-efficient hardware, we focus on infrastructure challenges alongside building software â€“ and that's exactly what Homebrew aims to do.

## Tinkering

We are AI tinkerers and engineers, solving problems in AI is our form of [play and work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_as_play). We've faced tons of challenges and created many solutions throughout our AI experiments and some of them have turned into products used by millions of people. 

## Future

Big inventions make humanity rethink all the things we have - AI is the same. It has the potential to enhance us and enable us to overcome challenges we couldn't yet imagine today. 

Our mission is to push humanity forward with the leverage of AI, by training models, running energy-efficiently, and providing full ownership and privacy.

## Solutions

At Homebrew, our work is based on three core pillars: **software**, **research**, and **infrastructure**.

- **Research**: We conduct research on AI that can hear, see, and augment human capabilities (e.g. [ðŸ¦„ llama3-s](https://github.com/homebrewltd/llama3-s)), and to develop products aligned with this vision.
- **Software**: We focus on solutions that provide full ownership. The first is [ðŸ‘‹ Jan](https://jan.ai/), a privacy-conscious personal AI. The second is [ðŸ¤– Cortex](https://cortex.so/), a local AI engine that also serves as Jan's brain.
- **Infrastructure**: Since AI is fundamentally tied to hardware, we also have an infrastructure division. We have data centers in Taiwan, Singapore, and Vietnam, where we are building GPU clusters.

## Business

Weâ€™ve observed that developing AI apps is easy, however, solving infrastructure issues while playing with AI is tough â€“ AI heavily relies on hardware. With this context, most AI companies fall into the "[pigs and lipstick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipstick_on_a_pig)" trap, eager to get rich quickly and accumulate capital by building apps. 

At Homebrew, we believe that solving tough infrastructure problems requires time and determination - once the big problems are solved, the money will follow. We play long-term.

Homebrew is a bootstrapped company, fully dedicated to human-augmented AI. For inquiries reach us at hello@homebrew.ltd and follow us on [Twitter](https://x.com/homebrewltd) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/janframework/).
