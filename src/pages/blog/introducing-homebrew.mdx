# Introducing Homebrew ðŸ––

Jan has been caffeinated - we are now Homebrew.

We started as an open-source team working on [Jan](https://jan.a), a personal AI. Along the way, we discovered many problems that needed solving at the software, hardware, and data center levels - and these challenges inspired us to think bigger and find better solutions.

To tackle these problems, we formed Homebrew. We've gone from Jan as an open-source project, to a "**Homebrew-ed**" group of hobbyists and tinkerers who are passionate about AI and want to build the future together.

What we're working on:
- [Jan](https://jan.ai): Our foundational personal AI project - still at the heart of what we do.
- [Cortex](https://cortex.so): A local AI engine, set to launch this week.
- Research: Training experimental models such as [llama3-s](https://github.com/homebrewltd/llama3-s).
- Hardware: Hands-on tinkering to explore energy-efficient solutions.

At Homebrew, weâ€™d love to build human-augmenting AIs that run on energy-efficient hardware. Drop us a line at [hello@homebrew.ltd](mailto:hello@homebrew.ltd) or DM us on Twitter or LinkedIn.
