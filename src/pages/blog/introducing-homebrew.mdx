# Jan is now part of something bigger: Homebrew

👋 Jan is now part of something bigger: 🖖 Homebrew

A year ago, we started working on Jan to enable anyone to run AI on their computer. 1 million downloads later, we’ve learned a lot about AI, and the issues faced at the product, software, hardware, and even datacenter levels. These challenges have inspired to us think bigger to find better solutions. 

Today, we’re becoming Homebrew, an AI research lab. We believe deeply in AI’s potential to push the human race forward, but believe there are difficult infrastructure problems that need time and commitment to solve.

What we’re working on: 

- [Jan](https://jan.ai): Personal AI - still at the heart of what we do
- [Cortex](https://cortex.so): A local AI engine (launching this week)
- Research: Practical models that solve problems (and the datasets that power them)
- Hardware: how do we make AI energy-efficient?

At our core, Homebrew’s culture is driven by who we are: AI enthusiasts who want to build practical, useful tools for ourselves and others. We are tinkerers: always excited about new innovations, and relentlessly finding ways to improve our product. 

To all our users and contributors: thank you 🙏. Our team is grateful for your bug reports, criticism, ideas, and feedback. We’re continually improving, and excited to ship new products in the months ahead.
